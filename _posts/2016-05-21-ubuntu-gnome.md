I have an Operating Systems course this semester and I wanted to try out different linux distros and Ubuntu flavours.
Currently, I'm running a dual boot hackintosh based - Windows10/OSX setup on my machine:

> **Lenovo Y50-70**<br>

> 2.5 Ghz i7-4710HQ<br>
> 8GB 1600Mhz RAM<br>
> 1TB Western Digital SSHD w/ 8GB SSD Cache<br>
> Nvidia GTX860m w/ 4GB vram<br>
> Intel HD4600 w/ 1536MB vram<br>
> 15.5 inch 1920x1080 TN panel<br>



I am using El Capitan on a daily basis right now which I find more convenient for daily tasks than the taxing Windows.

And so I had 2 options :

- Multi boot
- Virtual Appliance

Going with a multi-boot setup would greatly limit my setup to 3 or 4 (at max) including the hackintosh whereas I wanted to try out 5-6 distros.

So next was settling with a Virtual machine program on the OSX.Â 
VMWare Workstation / VirtualBox / Parallels

As I already had the setup of the trusted Parallels that Mac users use for installing Windows, I decided to give it a try.
