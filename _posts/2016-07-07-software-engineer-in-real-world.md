**Recently I came across this question on Quora**

[For a software engineer who doesn't find competitive programming interesting, is it still possible to land a job at one of big tech companies in the Valley?](https://www.quora.com/For-a-software-engineer-who-doesnt-find-competitive-programming-interesting-but-would-like-to-join-one-of-the-big-tech-companies-for-example-Google-Facebook-or-Microsoft-what-options-do-I-have-Is-it-still-possible-to-land-a-job-at-one-of-those-companies)

Now, I relate with the OP as I myself am not a big fan of competitive programming. 

This one answer, about what skills are relevant to get a great job at a great company, I found worth saving.

```

 Being able to write clear code is valuable. 
 Being able to work with other people is valuable.
 Being able to think carefully not under constrained time pressure is valuable. 
 Being able to work on problems that are ambiguous and being able to define a correct solution when no correct solution exists is valuable.
