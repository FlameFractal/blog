## Indexing

db.orders.aggregate( [ { $indexStats: { } } ] )

db.people.find().explain("executionStats")

Multikey , on every a key on every “value” of that array field. So make sure that is not a growing array


Restrictive first, sort last (almost always), acc to queries (predicate matching in compound), not too many indexes

partial filter index (special case Sparse), 

text index - like multikey. Use for smaller text fields only. Regex is colscan. Use compound index with text field possible. $text $search can be sorted with score

Count is same as find().count()



Why soft delete?
Save rebalancing b tree
