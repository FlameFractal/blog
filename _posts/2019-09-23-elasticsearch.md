## Basics
So, this is what I've learnt in my first brush with implementing elasticsearch in my work project recently.

  - an index - that indexes all fields with reverse indexing etc depending on type
  - provides restful searching

Questions

  - how to sync mongo writes and updates scalably and securely to ES?
  - redis -> logstash -> ES, mongodb ?
  - shingle, ngram, tokenizer, analyser, normalizer ???
