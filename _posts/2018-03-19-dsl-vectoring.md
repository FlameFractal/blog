Today my home broadband ISP (Airtel) upgraded my old DSL connection to vectored DSL for speeds upto 40Mbps. Still not Fibre, which I've been asking them about since over two years now. Better something than nothing.

But what the hell is this vectoring?

Vectoring is a atleast 5-10 year old technology developed by ISPs to increase bandwidth over existing copper connections instead of deploying costly fiber networks

It works by measuring cross-talk among hundreds of wires, then generating anti-phase signals using CPU-intensive calculations, to cancel the noise from the cross talk. It can achieve upto 100% noise free transmission.

The improved speeds can either be 100mbps (500 metres) or 40mbps (1000 metres)
