## Intro
Google Analytics helps to track visitors and analyse demographic, mobile/pc and other data to help the owner understand the behaviour of the users better.

I installed it on three of my websites today - [main website](//vishalgauba.me), [personal blog](//flamefractal.github.io) and [imad course blog](//imad-blog.herokuapp.com).

## Basic getting started :
1. Create google analytics account (preferrably with your own google account)
2. Create new property
3. Enter site details like name, url etc.
4. Get the tracking code (javascript or just the tracking id incase of beautiful-jekyll based site)
5. Add the tracking code to your site and commit/push

Repeat steps 2-5 for all sites.
