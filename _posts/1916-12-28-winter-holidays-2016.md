Winter Holidays - December 2016
Week 1: 10th to 17th
Week 2: 17th to 24th
Week 3: 24th to 31th
Next Semester: Spring 2017 - January 1.

This holiday was a complete waste. I had my last end-semester exam on 10th December, and I came back home that evening.

Right from the next day, the whitewash and renovation work began in my house. I was on labour-watch duty every morning, because my parents had to go to work, till the afternoon. This sucked up better part of the first week. Then I had to make several visits to the bank due to the demonetisation drive, and stand an hour in lines to reach the counter. 

By the evening I was much too tired almost every day that I watched a little YouTube or ELR[^1] and fall asleep right after dinner at around 10PM. Much before my usual bedtime of 2AM. Partly because I had to sleep in the same bed with my parents as the other rooms of the house were emptied for the whitewash, and they sleep very early which forced me to too.

This routine of being tired everyday and sleeping early has continued since. But the second week began with a much needed outing - me going out to meet a friend in CP. That was the only outing I'd had since November, when preparation for exams began, and so I was very relieved. It was a nice relaxing day, which can't be said for the next six days of the second week. The work in second week involved much less labour-watch duty because my dad took a few holidays from his work - but now because my dad was tired by the evening, I had to help mom around the house, and get groceries, milk and other stuff from the market. Anyways, the second week involved going out in the evening to different markets to survey for a new fridge and TV. 

In the beginning of the third week we finalised a Hitachi 650L fridge and the LG UHD-OLED-3D Smart TV. The first delivery of the fridge was a failed one as the product was defected and we sent it back. This meant a wastage of about 3 hours. As this was the last week, college action kicked back. Results of the previous semester came, and the registration process began. I spent a day figuring out the plan for next two semesters, dividing my credits, choosing the electives for the next semester and talking to people for their advice on courses. In the last couple of days, I started packing for college. And today, it is 31st of december - New Year's Eve, and I'm ready to go back tomorrow to the same old college life I had before these holidays.



In the beginning of this, I remarked that this holiday was a complete waste, that is because I had several projects in mind that I wanted to cater to in these three weeks. But ended up doing none of those due to lack of time and energy. Just want to put down those projects here so I can maybe pick up during off-time in the semester later.
