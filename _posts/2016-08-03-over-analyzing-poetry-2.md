[Introduction To Poetry](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/46712)

> I ask them to take a poem  
> and hold it up to the light  
> like a color slide  
> or press an ear against its hive.
> 
> I say drop a mouse into a poem  
> and watch him probe his way out,  
> or walk inside the poem's room  
> and feel the walls for a light switch.
>
> I want them to waterski  
> across the surface of a poem  
> waving at the author's name on the shore.  
>
>But all they want to do  
>is tie the poem to a chair with rope  
>and torture a confession out of it.
>
>They begin beating it with a hose  
>to find out what it really means.
