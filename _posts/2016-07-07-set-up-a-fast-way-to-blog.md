So a couple of days ago, I moved from wordpress to a Jekyll based blog. I didn't migrate all the data except a couple of posts. 

So my workflow would be like this when I had an idea that I wanted to write a post about:
  + Open the git directory on my local machine
  + Create a new file with data + title of the post
  + After writing up, do the usual git add/commit/push routine.

But this process hindered my creative juices and I wondered if i could automate this process.  
The idea was it should be as simple as 
  1. opening up a new blank file, 
  2. writing the blog post and 
  3. saving it.  
No hassle, whatsoever.  
  
Let's get started.
