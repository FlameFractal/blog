[Easily Over Analysed](http://hellopoetry.com/words/375406/over-analyzed/poems/)

> Poems about roads,  
> poems about ravens,  
> Poems about monsters,  
> and poems about roses.
>
> What do they mean? The road is a life,  
> the raven a regret,  
> the monster is you  
> and the rose is-  
>
> What.
>
> What happened to this?  
> Why can't it just be a rose?  
> A flower with thorns and red petals?  
> 
> “But the thorns are hardship and-”  
> No. Don't pretend you understand.  
> Don't give meaning to the meaningless.  
> Let the words speak on their own.
> 
> Interpret, sure, but don't over-analyze.  
> Let the words come and flow  
> unbroken by the lines of a chart,  
> splitting stanzas and lines into more manageable chunks.
> 
> Poetry is an art not meant for a spreadsheet.  
> Words flow from the heart and the soul,  
> from the subconscious where meaning is meaningless.
> 
> Where poetry remains whole.
> 
> I scratch my pen across the page  
> like a pen scratching across a page,  
> writing a poem about poetry,  
> Really.
>
> I write cloud and it means cloud,  
> I scrawl raven and I mean the bird,  
> I tap out road, and it refers to the pavement  
> and when I say rose, I mean rose.
>
> Beauty is not always in complexity,  
> sometimes it rests in simplicity.  
> Simplicity of thought and  
> of interpretation.
> 
> When my heart is aching  
> and I want to cry, how else can that be said?  
> When I make it an enigma:  
> crystal drops from earthen orbs
> 
> When I say what I want:  
> I buried my face in my hands   
> and sobbed.
> 
> Both equally beautiful,  
> both equally poetic  
> one clearly understood by anyone reading.
> 
> Poetry is my art, and I would hate to see it picked apart  
> like a frog in a biology class.  
> Each stanza  
> 
> Cut 
> 
> apart
> 
> qord by word
> 
> and phrase by phrase
> 
> to find any hidden meanings therein.
> 
> I've hidden nothing.
> 
> But don't over-analyze that statement.
