I got to know about this course from our Vice Chancellor during Summer '16. I quickly enrolled into it, and brushed my basic web dev skills in August. The course began on September 5, and by the end of the month I was granted moderatorship by our super cool instructor Tanmai sir. which was awesome.

From being simply a student, along with thousands of others, to a leader and moderator at the IMAD forums was a huge responsibility.

But getting to help and answer everyone's queries was an unmatched experience! I spent many an hour on the forums discussing and solving problems, downloading their code and finding the bugs, which felt tremendous due to the simple thank yous I got from everyone.

Having spent [more than 24 hours](https://discourse.imad.hasura.io/users/vg396/summary) on the forum and reading almost 5000 posts was definitely very time consuming.

P.S. The discourse admin console is pretty rad ;)
