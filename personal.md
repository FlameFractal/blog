### SenticNet
**Research Assistant** | April 2016 - Present

The [SenticNet](http://sentic.net) team is a multidisciplinary research group based at the School of Computer Science and Engineering at NTU, lead by [Dr Erik Cambria](http://sentic.net/erikcambria/).

Sentic computing focuses on polarity detection and emotion recognition of natural language by leveraging on semantics and linguistics instead of solely statistical methods. I'm working on word representations and deep learning in that context.

I'm very happy I got this opportunity to be involved with real research. It all started a semester ago when I decided to audit the Machine Learning course at NTU out of fascination. I'm glad I pursued it despite not getting academic credit for it!
