### SenticNet
**Research Assistant** | April 2016 - Present

The [SenticNet](http://sentic.net) team is a multidisciplinary research group based at the School of Computer Science and Engineering at NTU, lead by [Dr Erik Cambria](http://sentic.net/erikcambria/).

Sentic computing focuses on polarity detection and emotion recognition of natural language by leveraging on semantics and linguistics instead of solely statistical methods. I'm working on word representations and deep learning in that context.

I'm very happy I got this opportunity to be involved with real research. It all started a semester ago when I decided to audit the Machine Learning course at NTU out of fascination. I'm glad I pursued it despite not getting academic credit for it!

### My First Drawing
**CCC Human Faces** | February 2015

Okay. So a couple of things i realised while taking a shot at my first drawing:

1. Draw big. 
	Whenever we start for the first time, we tend to make tiny image. Buy a big sketch book. Cover atleast 40% of the area with the subject.
	The bigger the sketch is, the more engrossing it is to the viewer. 

2. Have a background.
	A sketch looks a lot better with some initial haphazard shading before starting the subject.

3. Have a variety of tools.
	Before starting a sketch, have a couple of different pencils with you. Try out all the Bs and the Hs and figure out what they do by using them in a variety of pressures. Also charcoal, if possible, gives a greater flowy tonality. This will help you to achieve what's in your mind better on paper.

4. Do not fuss/erase over something to achieve the "perfect" curve.
	You will feel the urge to erase one part over and over again because it isn't the perfect curve you want! 
	But keep going my friend, do not stop and waste time over it. In hindsight you shall see that in the end the drawing will come out to be just fine and that curve would look pretty good too.
