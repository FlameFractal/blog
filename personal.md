# Poetry Course
**CCC** | Monsoon 2016

As I'm doing a Poetry Appreciation course this semester, I really relate to this person's thoughts after the first couple of lectures.

[Why I Hate Poetry](http://michiedo.blogspot.in/2008/05/why-i-hate-poetry.html)

Some snippets from the post :

![Cow Poetry](../assets/img/cowpoetry.jpg)

>	 I hate that with poetry, we are expected to read into it all. 

>	With poetry, you’re given basically nothing, and you’re expected to identify facts that you would have absolutely no way of knowing. It’s ridiculous.

>	I do think poetry is occasionally respectable. I guess, I’m in favor of the privatization of poetry. 

I can understand how dissecting poetry can help us create symbolism, and watch for subtleties in writing. I can also see how poetry can sometimes be fun. I like some poetry, when I make it mean something new to me instead of trying to guess why the author wrote it. I do also enjoy the challenge of creating poems with particular rhythms. I like funny poetry. I think that some poems are kind of like a collage of senses; they can combine smells and imagery and those sorts of things, and that’s kind of interesting and even occasionally powerful.

Generally, though, I think poetry tends to be a big game of “Guess what I’m thinking!” and I hate that game. I’m not a mind-reader. I think a lot of people who get excited about poetry are really pretentious

**Aug 3** | Lec-2

Discussion on the interpretation of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star implying hidden/metaphorical meanings of the poem.

1. written as a poem by Jane Taylor and published with the title "The Star" in *Rhymes for the Nursery* by Jane and her sister Ann Taylor in London in *1806*
2. Astronomy was a subject deeply explored since before christ. And humans knew quite a lot about stars by 18th century. For taste of reference, Gallileo lived in 16th century.
3. books for children, including nursery rhymes, were luxury objects produced during the eighteenth-century Britain. This notion of luxury is encoded in the poem's diction, however, by the "diamond" simile. 
4. "The Star" ... ecological awareness for the children of the rich.



**Q. Why do poets use rhymes and meter in poetry? Is it for enjoyment?** <br>
**A.** Maybe. But the more seeming reason could be that poems were at a time when people didn't read or write. So poems were an important form of communication which were verbally passed from person to person. Rhymes and meters make a poem easy to remember which was the key behind it's usage. Nursery rhymes rely on meter and rhyme to stick into our memories


There was a lot of discussion of how most of the poems have political meaning and this one is the most agreed upon.

**Q. Is ring around the roses about the great Black Plague?** <br>
**A.**	You would find a lot of reference that folklore scholars regard the theory as baseless.
		<br> One of the reasons of which is that the plague explanation did not appear until the mid-twentieth century (Opie and Opie (1985), p. 224).

Iona and Peter Opie was the couple that produced the famous The Oxford Nursery Ryhme Book.
If you do believe their interpretation of ring around the roses, then believe it or not, they also do not mention any metaphorical meaning to this song in "The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes". apparently it's just a song about literal stars, written by Jane Taylor in 1806.

# My First Drawing
**CCC Human Faces** | February 2015

Okay. So a couple of things i realised while taking a shot at my first drawing:

1. Draw big. 
	Whenever we start for the first time, we tend to make tiny image. Buy a big sketch book. Cover atleast 40% of the area with the subject.
	The bigger the sketch is, the more engrossing it is to the viewer. 

2. Have a background.
	A sketch looks a lot better with some initial haphazard shading before starting the subject.

3. Have a variety of tools.
	Before starting a sketch, have a couple of different pencils with you. Try out all the Bs and the Hs and figure out what they do by using them in a variety of pressures. Also charcoal, if possible, gives a greater flowy tonality. This will help you to achieve what's in your mind better on paper.

4. Do not fuss/erase over something to achieve the "perfect" curve.
	You will feel the urge to erase one part over and over again because it isn't the perfect curve you want! 
	But keep going my friend, do not stop and waste time over it. In hindsight you shall see that in the end the drawing will come out to be just fine and that curve would look pretty good too.
